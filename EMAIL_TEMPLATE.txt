Subject: Tic‑Tac‑Toe (React) — build attached

Hi,

I attached a ZIP containing a ready-to-run build of the Tic‑Tac‑Toe React game.

Instructions (short):
- Unzip the archive.
- Open `README-windows.txt` or `README-windows-en.txt` for run options.

Recommended (robust):
1. Install Node.js if not already installed: https://nodejs.org
2. Open PowerShell in the unzipped folder and run:
   `npx serve -s build -l 3000`
3. Open `http://localhost:3000` in the browser.

If you prefer not to install Node, open a terminal in the `build` folder and run:
`py -3 -m http.server 3000` (then open `http://localhost:3000`).

If anything doesn't work, reply to this email and I'll help.

Best,
[Dein Name]
